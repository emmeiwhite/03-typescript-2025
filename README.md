# TypeScript

- TypeScript is JavaScript with types
- Helps in finding bugs during development
- Increase development time due to auto suggestions on Objects etc
- We will have to write more code (to enable types) but it is worth it

## Installation Guide

- npm i -g typescript

## Run the TS file

- tsc fileName.ts

## Type Alias

- To basically create custom types - defines the shape of objects

- type User

## Type vs Interface

In TypeScript, type and interface are very similar â€” both let you define the shape of objects, and in many cases, they can be used interchangeably. However, there are some nuanced differences, especially when it comes to extending, merging, and using with unions or tuples.
